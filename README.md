## Personal note

As a personal note: this was the semester I had strong doubts if studying computer science was the right thing for me and if I saw myself doing this for the rest of my life. As I was not in a good mental state, I took the decision to abandon my studies completely this semester with the option to retake them next semester, whilst I also thought if starting to doing something else was the correct choice or not. Eventually, I decided to come back, although I'll never understand why I did so (even though there are no regrets as I learnt a lot of stuff that might be useful sometime in the future). So this project you're seeing is incomplete, as I never got to present it. I did, however, finish it for the next semester , which you can see [here, on my github profile.](https://github.com/Naateri/gestorBD2)

Ever since then, on my time as a computer science student, I never felt happy: I was always in a bad mood, and it took me some time to realize that it was because I was forcing myself to study something I really did not like and something I didn't see myself being happy with in the future. With the pandemic in 2020 and having a lot of time to think about stuff, I had another really strong crisis (stronger than the one that happened in 2018) which led me to feeling awful all day every day and making my mind have thoughts about stuff which I won't mention here, but I'm pretty sure you can imagine what it is. So at that point, after speaking with everyone I love and care about, I decided enough is enough and decided to leave my computer science studies there, as there is no point in putting a lot of effort into completing something that, more likely than not, won't be useful in my life. 

So, long story short, I'm no longer a Computer Science student because it doesn't matter if you're really good at something if you're being really unhappy and being hurtful to the people you love the most. Ironically, I got first place in academic results last two semesters I studied, including the crisis semester, so that's something I guess?

I have no idea if someone will read this someday, but if you do and are in a similar situation, think about what you're doing and start doing things that you really enjoy, it's never too late to do so and life is too short to spend it doing stuff you hate, even if you're good at it. 

Will I keep using github? For sure, the only bit I enjoyed about programming was data analysis, and python is really helpful for that, so I am learning about that on my freetime.
Are there more repos like this one from the semester I left? Yes, but they'll probably stay private for a long time (except maybe the Design and Analysis of Algorithms one, as there's lots of interesting stuff there).
Regarding me, if you've somehow found this and are still reading it, I'm in a much better mental space right now, and I'm actually excited and hopeful for my future, something that I hadn't for a really long time.
